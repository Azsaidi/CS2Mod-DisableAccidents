# Disable Accidents


The Disable Traffic Accidents Mod is a simple yet effective modification for the game, designed to prevent all traffic accidents from occurring within the game's simulation. When enabled, this mod ensures that vehicles will never crash into each other, eliminating disruptions caused by collisions while maintaining smooth traffic flow. This is perfect for players who want a more controlled and predictable city environment without random traffic incidents.

### **How It Works**
By modifying the game's traffic accident system, this mod prevents the game from registering collisions between vehicles. While vehicles will still move normally and obey traffic laws, accidents will no longer occur while the mod is enabled and toggled on. This removes those annoying 78 multivehicular accidents on your highways!

### **Enabling the Mod**
By default, the mod is **not activated** when first installed. To enable it:

1. Open the game's **Settings** menu.
2. Navigate to the **Mods** section.
3. Locate **Disable Accidents** in the list of installed mods.
4. Toggle the mod **ON** to activate it.
5. Once enabled, traffic accidents will no longer occur in the game.

To **disable the mod**, simply toggle it **OFF** in the same menu, and the game will resume its default behavior where accidents can occur normally.

### **Savegame Compatibility and Mod Removal**
This mod is completely safe to use and does not affect savegame data. You can enable or disable it at any time without corrupting your saves. If you decide to remove the mod, your game will revert to its standard traffic accident behavior without any issues.

### **Acknowledgements**
A special thanks to **Bruceyboy24804**, **StarQ**, and **rcav8tr** for their invaluable assistance in developing this mod. Their guidance and expertise were instrumental in bringing this project to life!

Enjoy your accident-free roads!
